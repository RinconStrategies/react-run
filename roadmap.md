#React.run Roadmap

Here are the items that we have on the board to get implemented and would represent our perfect in-browser React env.

## Complete
- [x] Auto compile JSX/ES6 with Babel
- [x] Create and Save revisions
- [x] Add external JS and CSS resources
- [x] Track the state of your component across refreshes (persist to the server)

## Work started 
- [ ] Time travel debugging of state changes. 
- [ ] Allow auto installation of NPM modules, and subsequent bundling using Webpack. 

## Future
- [ ] Inform user, in the window, of React specific warnings and errors 
- [ ] Support changing the [brace](https://github.com/thlorenz/brace) theme. Suprisingly, not everyone likes Solarized Dark
- [ ] Add a functional split-pane system
- [ ] Sharing and linking to output
- [ ] Exports, Exports, Exports. Export code only, download files for running locally, generate starter project
- [ ] Embeds - Allow a version to be framed and embedded on other sites.
