# README #

This is a basic react SPA starter template for use at RS. It includes -

* React
* React-Router
* Bootstrap SASS
* Font-Awesome SASS
* Webpack/Browsersync 

and more. 

Things intentionally left out -

* Server - this is a fully client side SPA app, there is no server side component
* Flux - this is a simple react app with no flux dependencies. Use only for SMALL projects. Anything complex should introduce flux.

## Running

```npm install```
then run
``` gulp ```
