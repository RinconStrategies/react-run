#React.run

## What is it?
React.run is an in-browser [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) that allows you to write, run, and experiment writing
React components in the browser with no additional tools or configuration. It is the fastest way to get started learning
the patterns and practices of React.

##Features
* Automatic Babel transpilation of React JSX/ES6 code
* Create and save multiple revisions
* Add external Javascript and CSS resources
* Track the state of your component, save that state to the server, and "rehydrate" the state when the revision is loaded

Even more features are on the horizon. We are tracking features we would like implement in the [Roadmap]()
